# CareOS Portal (POC)

CareOS is a concept portal demonstrating a modern, role-aware care experience for patients, caregivers, and clinicians.

This project is a **design and product proof-of-concept**, not a production system.

## What this demonstrates

- A role-based care portal experience:
  - Patient
  - Caregiver
  - Clinician (Login As / support view)
  - Developer (demo mode)
- Clear visual context for “who you are” and “who you’re viewing”
- A shared care surface across documents, care plans, messaging, and timeline
- Modern, calm UI patterns suitable for healthcare use
- How a single portal can support multiple care personas without confusion

## What this is not

- Not connected to real healthcare systems
- Not using real patient data
- Not production-ready authentication or authorization

## Tech stack

- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Deployed on Vercel

## Why this exists

This project exists to explore:
- Product thinking around role-based healthcare portals
- UX clarity in complex care relationships
- Rapid prototyping using modern AI-assisted development tools
